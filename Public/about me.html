<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
My name is Morgan and I'm a beginning webdeveloper. I started this journey with a lot of motivation and very little knowledge about coding. 
I found Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp using the free resources available to me via my local public library. I've had a love of problem
solving and creating my whole life. Being stuck in the customer service job cycle, I wasn't able to utilize either without the proper 
compensation, recognition, or avenue for job growth. In order to better myself and my family I started learning web development as it 
fulfilled both my love for creativity and problem solving."
